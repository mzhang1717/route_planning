# Dijkstra's and A* Search Algorithms
This project provides Python Class of the Dijkstra's and 
A* Search Algorithms.

The RoutePlanner class provides two options of distance 
heuristic. When this heuristic is set to Euclidean, this
class performs A* search with the Euclidean distance heuristic. 
When it is set to zero, this class essentially performs Dijkstra
search.

# Usage
Execute the following command in a terminal: `python3 main.py`
The example code will show the route planning results between 
two locations near Downtown Toronto.
